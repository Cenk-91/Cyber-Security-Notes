1. Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds to create a new free operating system kernel.

2. It is written in the C programming language.

3. It was inspired by Unix -1970's AT&T Bell Labs- but built from scratch without using Unix code.

4. There are more than 600 distributions on Linux.

5. You can use the `man` command in the terminal to view a command's manual.

6. In Linux, commands are case-sensitive. For example, `ls` and LS are different — LS will not work.

7. `ls -l` shows files and folders in long list format with details like permissions, owner, size, and date.

8. `command --help` or `help command` (bash) displays a quick help summary for the command. Shows available options and syntax.

9. `pwd` Print Working Directory - Prints the current working directory. It tells you where you are in the file system.

10. `mkdir` is used to create a new directory (folder). (make directory)

11. `rmdir` is used to remove an empty directory. Gives error if the directory contains files. (remove directory)

12. The `rm -r` command deletes a directory and its contents recursively.

13. The `cd` command is used to change the current directory in the terminal. It stands for "change directory".
  `cd ..`   # Goes one directory up
  `cd ~`    # Goes to the home directory

14. The `touch` command creates a new empty file. If the file already exists, it updates its timestamp.
`touch filename.txt`

15. The `mv` command renames a file if the destination is a new name and moves a file if the destination is a folder.
``` mv eski_ad.txt yeni_ad.txt | mv belge.txt /home/cenk/Documents/ | mv belge.txt /home/cenk/Documents/yeni_ad.txt ```

16. The `netstat` command shows current network connections, listening ports, routing tables, and interface statistics.
	Example: `netstat -tuln` shows all TCP/UDP ports that are open for listening.

17. The `whoami` command prints the username of the current user. Useful to verify if you have root privileges or are in a standard session.

18. The `who` command displays a list of users currently logged into the system.

19. The `uptime` command shows how long the system has been running since the last reboot.

20. `uname -a` (Unix name all)
	Displays system information: kernel name, network node host name, kernel release, version, machine hardware name, processor type, and more.
	Useful for checking your OS version and architecture.

21. `df -h` (Disk free human-readable)
	Shows disk space usage of all mounted file systems in a human-readable format (e.g., GB/MB).
	Helps monitor storage space, especially in /home, /, or /var.

22. `cp` used to copy files or directories. 
	`cp source.txt target.txt`
	`cp -r` # copies a folder

23. `clear` or `ctrl + l`  clears the terminal screen


24. `echo` 
	Used to display a line of text or variable value in the terminal. Often used in shell scripts and for writing to files.
`echo "Merhaba Cenk!"`
`echo "Deneme" > dosya.txt` Creates a new file and writes "Deneme" into it - overwrites if it already exists — be careful!
`echo "Yeni satır" >> dosya.txt` Appends "Yeni satır" to the end of the existing file without overwriting it.

25. `cat` Displays the content of files in the terminal. Can also be used to concatenate multiple files or create new ones.
`cat dosya.txt` Displays the contents of the file named dosya.txt in the terminal.
`cat dosya1.txt dosya2.txt > birlesik.txt` Combines two files and writes them into a new file named birlesik.txt.
	concatenate(v.) to link or combine things together in a series or chain. This command was originally designed to concatenate (link together) multiple files.
	Today, it is commonly used to display the content of files, but it still carries its original name.

26. `history` Displays the history of previously entered terminal commands.
`!25` 
`history -c`

27. `grep` Searches for a string or pattern in text or command output. (Global Regular Expression Print)
	`grep "Cenk" notes.txt`
	Shows the lines in notes.txt that contain the word "Cenk".

`ps aux | grep firefox`
	Filters and displays running processes that include the word "firefox".

`grep -i "lina" logs.txt`
	Searches for "lina" in logs.txt, ignoring case (matches "LINA", "Lina", etc.).

28. `find`
	`find -name passwords.txt`
	`find -name "*.txt"`

29. `wc` Shows line, word, and byte count of a file.
`wc filename.txt`
`wc -l` Shows only the number of lines in a file or output.
`wc -l filename.txt`
	Can be piped with other commands:
	`grep "python" notes.txt | wc -l`

30. Symbol / Operator    -  	Description
`&`	                This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
`&&`	                This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
`>`	                This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat) and direct it elsewhere.
`>>`	                This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).
