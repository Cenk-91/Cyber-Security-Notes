Reconnaissance (Recon)
Recon is the first phase of ethical hacking, focused on gathering as much information about the target as possible.

DEFENSIVE
To exploit: To take advantage of a vulnerability in a system to perform unauthorized actions.
1-Preventing intrusions from occurring
2-Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
WHAT THEY DO : 
-  User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targeting their systems.
-  Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protect adequately.
-  Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and 
patched against any known vulnerability.
-  Setting up preventative security devices: Firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of 
preventative security. 
Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. 
IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
-  Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activities and 
intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it.
A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect
malicious cyber security events.

  Networking : It is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share data and resources.
  The Internet is a global network of networks that allows computers and devices around the world to communicate and share data.
  The ARPANET project in the late 1960s - Tim Berners-Lee / The creation of the World Wide Web 1989
  An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network. It allows devices 
to identify and communicate with each other.
  Private IP	Used within local networks (e.g. 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x). Not accessible from the internet.
  Public IP	Used on the internet. Assigned by the ISP to identify the network externally.
  Public IPv4: 86.157.52.21  
  Public IPv6: 2a00:22c4:a531:c500:425f:cce6:c36b:f64d
  MAC (Media Access Control) address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each network interface card.
  Format: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
  First 6 digits = manufacturer (e.g., Intel)
  Last 6 digits = unique to the device
  MAC Spoofing 
- Faking a deviceâ€™s MAC address to pretend to be another device.  
- Used to bypass MAC filters (e.g., in firewalls, cafes, captive portals).
  - ip a
  - ipconfig /all
  Ping - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
