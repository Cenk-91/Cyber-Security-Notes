Reconnaissance (Recon)
Recon is the first phase of ethical hacking, focused on gathering as much information about the target as possible.

DEFENSIVE
To exploit: To take advantage of a vulnerability in a system to perform unauthorized actions.
1-Preventing intrusions from occurring
2-Detecting intrusions when they occur and responding properly
WHAT THEY DO : 
-  User cyber security awareness: Training users about cyber security helps protect against attacks targeting their systems.
-  Documenting and managing assets: We need to know the systems and devices we must manage and protect adequately.
-  Updating and patching systems: Ensuring that computers, servers, and network devices are correctly updated and 
patched against any known vulnerability.
-  Setting up preventative security devices: Firewall and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are critical components of 
preventative security. 
Firewalls control what network traffic can go inside and what can leave the system or network. 
IPS blocks any network traffic that matches present rules and attack signatures.
-  Setting up logging and monitoring devices: Proper network logging and monitoring are essential for detecting malicious activities and 
intrusions. If a new unauthorized device appears on our network, we should be able to detect it.
A SECURITY OPERATIONS CENTER (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect
malicious cyber security events.

  Networking : It is the practice of connecting computers and other devices together to share data and resources.
  The Internet is a global network of networks that allows computers and devices around the world to communicate and share data.
  The ARPANET project in the late 1960s - Tim Berners-Lee / The creation of the World Wide Web 1989
  An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network. It allows devices 
to identify and communicate with each other.
  Private IP	Used within local networks (e.g. 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x). Not accessible from the internet.
  Public IP	Used on the internet. Assigned by the ISP to identify the network externally.
  Public IPv4: 86.157.52.21  
  Public IPv6: 2a00:22c4:a531:c500:425f:cce6:c36b:f64d
  MAC (Media Access Control) address is a 12-digit hexadecimal number assigned to each network interface card.
  Format: aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff
  First 6 digits = manufacturer (e.g., Intel)
  Last 6 digits = unique to the device
  MAC Spoofing 
- Faking a device’s MAC address to pretend to be another device.  
- Used to bypass MAC filters (e.g., in firewalls, cafes, captive portals).
  - ip a
  - ipconfig /all
  Ping - ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)

  Local Area Network (LAN)
  Star Topology : All devices (computers, phones, etc.) are individually connected to a central networking device — usually a switch or hub.
All communication between devices goes through this central device.
  Bus Topology : This type of connection relies upon a single connection which is known as a backbone cable.
  The Ring Topology (also known as token topology) : Devices such as computers are connected directly to each other to form a loop.
  Switches are dedicated devices within a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printers, 
or any other networking-capable device using ethernet. 
  Router : It's a router's job to connect networks and pass data between them.
  Subnetting means splitting a large network into smaller sections (called subnets).
  What is a Subnet Mask? It shows which part of the IP address is for the network and which is for devices (hosts).
Examples: /24 = 255.255.255.0 = allows 254 usable devices - /16 = 255.255.0.0 = allows 65,534 usable devices
  Network Address
     Identifies the whole network
     Cannot be assigned to a device
     Like the apartment building’s address
     Example: 192.168.1.0
  Host Address
     Assigned to a specific device (computer, phone, etc.)
     Like a flat number in the building
     Examples: 192.168.1.10, 192.168.1.42, 192.168.1.100
  Default Gateway (ip route)
     Used to exit the network (to access the internet)
     Like the main door of the building
     Often: 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.1.254
  ARP is used to map an IP address to a MAC address in a local network. (arp -a)
It helps devices find out "Who has this IP address?" and get the corresponding MAC address.
ARP Request > ARP Reply > Caching
  DHCP – Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol - DHCP Discover > DHCP Offer > DHCP Request > DHCP ACK
  DNS – Domain Name System - DNS translates domain names into IP addresses.
