Linux began in 1991 as a personal project by Finnish student Linus Torvalds to create a new free operating system kernel.
It is written in the C programming language.
It was inspired by Unix -1970s, AT&T Bell Labs- but built from scratch without using Unix code.
There are more than 600 distributions on Linux.
